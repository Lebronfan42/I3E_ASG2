# Project Name: MAYDAY 

Description: Mayday is a fast-paced shooter where the player must explore an alien planet and find parts to repair the ship and escape. You play as a Space Cadet who crashes and lands on an alien planet while fighting. Your ship is broken and the only way to fix it is to find the parts needed. But some enemies block your way. You are equipped with dual pistols and must defeat whoever comes in your way 

 

Main Features: 

Three different Enemy AIs do different amounts of damage and have different health. They can spot you and start shooting at you if you get too close. The player can engage in combat with these Aliens and defeat them. 

Dual Pistols are your best friends here as they are the only weapon you get to defend yourself. With the left click being your left weapon and the right click being your right weapon, you can have an insane fire rate to take out your foes. 

Exploration is a big part of this game. The player will have to explore to find the way to continue forward. The world is made with many different unique structures that you can see back here on earth. 

Dynamic Health Bar where every time you take a hit, your screen turns a little red. The redder your screen, the closer you are to dying
